# learning_stuff
Here I add some silly project I come up with. Mostly simple stuff.
UPD: Right now I'm working on small project that allows you to generate fantasy characters based on DnD/Pathfinder standarts.
Done so far: - Parameters generation (3d6) 
             - Re-roll of chosen stat (Str/Dex/Con/Wis/Int/Cha) - player is able to re-roll any of the stats.
             - Attached Fantasy name generator which allows to generate First Name + Last Name from two lists of names.
